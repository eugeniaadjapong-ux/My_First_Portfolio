            About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            I build clean, user-centered front-end experiences and enjoy solving real problems using code. My path began with multiple coding bootcamps and the ALX Professional Foundation Program, where I strengthened collaborative and problem-solving skills and worked on a social-impact app addressing galamsey (illegal mining) in Ghana — enabling people in affected areas to report incidents and access learning resources.
